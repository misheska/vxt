 * vxt_auth.c
 *
 * The VxT authorization service provides the for Vxt controller 
 * guest identification and authorization.  To do this it relies
 * on an Authorization database.  In some cases this database
 * resides in the hypervisor or transport device specific domain
 *
 * To support this properly we export an implementation independent
 * interface to query the authorization database.
 *
 * Exported Interfaces:

 * Note:  The following export is not dependent on vxtctrlr
 *        callbacks and therefore can be called by the authorization
 *        service prior to the installation of the vxtctrlr module.
