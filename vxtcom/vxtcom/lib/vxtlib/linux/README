This directory contains the files needed to build the
vxt_socket interface for linux guests, sitting on top
of a XenSource hypervisor.

The socket interface is contained in vxt_socket_dev.c
It wraps the vxt_msg facility which presents a two-way
shared memory queue device.

The vxt_msg device is vended from the vxt_cntrlr.  The
vxt_cntrlr is an abstracted bus.  The bus has a 
well developed configuration capability that allows
for the dynamic creation and destruction of devices.
The controller is tied into a configuration authority
so that new devices may be attached to suitable endpoints
at the guest operating systems request.
